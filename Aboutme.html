            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Background: I am currently an Information Technology Major here at Kennesaw State University. 
            I am bilingual with having the ability to speak Spanish and English. 
            I've lived here in Georgia all my life, used to live in Canton, now in Kennesaw ever since 2016.
            I attended high school here in cobb county at Kell high school and graduated in 2022.
            Some hobbies I have are, going to the Gym, playing soccer, swimming, or playing video games with friends.

            <p>Experiences: The time I have been at Kennesaw State University has shown me countless amounts of things I never knew about.
            Here at KSU I have been introduced to short-term and long-term friends, making new friendships because of having the same course.
            Also I have seen some familiar faces here at this school with people from high school.
            I have picked up on skills that will help me in the long run such as being able to code in multiple programming languages. 
            Those languages are Java, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL.
            I have also joined an organization called OLAS here at KSU and it has been the best decision of my life.
            They have workshops monthly, fundraising events, events to get involved around campus, and an overall a great community while meeting other Latino/Latina students. </p>

            <p>Goals: Long-terms goals I have set for myself later in life is to become a Systems analyst.
            Buy my dream house with a big yard and have 3 big dogs and name them after Greek mythology god/goddesses names.
            Having my dream car which currently is a GT3 Porsche 911.
            Achieving the body physique I am currently working for which will require consistency and a lot of discipline and dieting.
            Some short-term goals I have are being able to master the programming languages I listed in my Experiences section because for one I could say I know how to code but not professionally yet.
